# 👋 Hey, I’m Eirik Hanasand

I’m a **software engineer and security-minded developer** passionate about building tools that make development safer, faster, and more enjoyable. I love exploring the intersection of **software engineering, cybersecurity, and design** — where clean code meets practical impact. (Sorry for making GPT write this 😂, I would need more than 48 hours in a day to get everything I wanted done. I will write it meself at some point. Remember that this is a personal website, and only supposed to be half serious 🍹)

## 🧠 What Drives Me

I’m motivated by curiosity and craftsmanship. Whether I’m hardening an API, improving a CI pipeline, or designing a React interface, I aim for **clarity, simplicity, and security by default**.

I believe software should help people — and it should do so **without getting in their way**.

## 🧰 What I Build

Some projects I’ve worked on recently:

- 🧩 **Library Safety Manager (LSM)** — an Artifactory extension that scans packages for vulnerabilities and malware using the OSV database.  
- 📱 **Event Management App** — a React Native app to simplify event coordination.  
- 🤖 **Discord Bot for Infrastructure Automation** — combining IaC principles with developer community tools.  
- 🌐 **Open Source Libraries** — small UI utilities, SSR/theming experiments in Next.js, and other contributions on [GitHub](https://github.com/eirikhanasand).

## 🛡️ My Focus Areas

- Secure development & supply-chain protection  
- JavaScript / TypeScript, React, and Next.js  
- DevOps & automation (CI/CD, IaC)  
- Developer experience (DX) and open-source tooling  

---

## 🌱 Currently Exploring

- Software supply-chain security research  
- Smarter mobile-web integrations for events and collaboration  
- Writing technical deep-dives on security and performance  
- Building small, opinionated tools to make developers’ lives easier
