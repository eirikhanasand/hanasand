# dizambee
Website to practice for zammad written in Nextjs, TypeScript and Tailwind.
This website is a complete implementation of a card based learning website with all functionality implemented.
In theory this website could be put in production and work out of the box.

## Building
To start the frontend run `docker compose up`. This will start the website on port 3000, and the api on port 8080. The secrets required are detailed on the wiki (will be added here later).
